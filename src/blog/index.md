# Here's what people are saying

I wish you all very happy Holi! In midst of festivity and celebration I am feeling glad to mention few contributions to GALAXY development. Glactic blog has been a good place to put our technical experiences well blanded with our routine ones. I will mention 
what I gone through learning GALAXY through-out my M.Tech study and ahead.
